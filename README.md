Storytellers love telling **stories**, and this toolkit strives to allow 
the cratives more freedom in the pursuit of what sets their :heart: on :fire:.

A story can be long, short, sweet or sour. Whatever it maybe, and whatever be your style,
this toolkit allows you to create promo material to reach the target audience faster.

## Architecture
The main entities of this program are:
1. Story - the main entity.
2. Author - every story is written by someone.
3. Domain - for better categorisation and search.
4. Body - the main body of the story.
5. Headline - the main, catchy line, of the Story.
6. Synopsis - TL;DR; a summary comprising the essence of Story.
7. Headshot - a related or promotional image/graphic for Story.
